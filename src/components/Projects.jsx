      <li>I did a Mini project on Generative AI
Developed a mini-project exploring the capabilities of generative AI in text and voice conversion. This project focused on two key areas:
Text-to-Text Conversion: Investigated the application of generative AI models for tasks like:
Text summarization: Condensing lengthy text into concise summaries.
Text style transfer: Modifying the writing style (e.g., formal to informal) while preserving content.
Machine translation: Translating text from one language to another using AI.
Voice-to-Text Conversion: Explored the use of speech recognition models for:
Real-time voice transcription: Converting spoken words into written text.
Speaker identification: Recognizing the speaker based on voice characteristics
